In this assignment, you will delve deep into Stable Diffusion Models based on the DDPMs paper. The notebook is fragmented into three main parts: Forward Diffusion, the Unet Architecture of Noise Predictor Model with training and the Sampling part of Stable Diffusion Models. By completing this assignment, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the mathematics underlying stable diffusion and practical skills to implement and work with these models.
